# OMR-Evaluator-
A website to evaluate OMR sheets using image processing

OMR sheets have been widely used across the globe for grading purposes. It is a process of
evaluating human-marked data from documents such as surveys and tests. This technology acts
as a guide or helping tool for processing large amount of data, mainly questionnaires and
multiple-choice questions. Almost all the educational institutions in our country use OMR
technology. The exam taker has to feel the bubble or the box as an appropriate answer to the
question. The following proposed system helps to scan the input sheets and store the result in the
database, so the user can see the saved scores. It is done by using various image processing
techniques such as Gaussian filtering, BGR to Gray, edge detection, thresholding, compliment of
the image. The answers marked for each of the questions help evaluate the sheet and display the
total marks. This system eliminates the installation of heavy machinery, and expensive scanners
in return saving time and cost. The proposed work consists of an ordinary smartphone camera
and a computer for computation purposes.
